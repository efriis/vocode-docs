## Overview

Vocode supports using agents with inbound and outbound phone calls. Users
can [create their own agents](/create-your-own-agent) and use them
to fulfill a variety of use cases like information collection, appointment scheduling,
sales, customer support, and more.

## Outbound Calls

The `OutboundCall` class provides a simple abstraction for creating outbound calls.

### OutboundCall Class

<ParamField path="recipient" type="CallEntity" required={true}>
  The recipient entity for the phone call.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="caller" type="CallEntity" required={true}>
  The caller entity for the phone call.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agent_config" type="AgentConfig" required={true}>
  The configuration for the AI agent.
</ParamField>

### Example: Making an outbound call

```python
from vocode.telephony.outbound_call import OutboundCall
from vocode.models.telephony import CallEntity
from vocode.models.agent import WebSocketUserImplementedAgentConfig

if __name__ == '__main__':
    call = OutboundCall(
        recipient=CallEntity(
            phone_number="+12345678900",
        ),
        caller=CallEntity(
            phone_number="+12345678900",
        ),
        agent_config=WebSocketUserImplementedAgentConfig(
            respond=WebSocketUserImplementedAgentConfig.RouteConfig(
                url="ws://localhost:3001/respond"
            )
        )
    )
    call.start()
```

## Inbound Calls

The `InboundCall` class provides a simple abstraction to create an endpoint that can host your agent
to respond to inbound calls. In order to implement an inbound call agent, start by defining an `InboundCall`
like so:

```python
from vocode.telephony.inbound_call_server import InboundCallServer
from vocode.models.agent import YourAgentConfig

if __name__ == '__main__':
    server = InboundCallServer(
        agent_config=YourAgentConfig(initial_message="hello!")
    )
    server.run(port=3001)
```

This spins up a FastAPI web server with a `/vocode` route that returns a TwiML object that we will need in the next
step.

Next, we'll set up a programmable phone number on Twilio that can accept the TwiML object from
above. To do this,

1. Create a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account
2. Once inside your dashboard, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Buy a number to get a phone number.
3. Then, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Active Numbers and select the number you want to set up.
4. Update the config to use a Webhook while making sure to use the correct URL
