## Introduction

Vocode provides tools and abstractions to build any kind of voice-based application
on top of LLMs. Examples of things you can build with Vocode include setting up LLMs
to answer/make phone calls, act as personal assistants, join Zoom meetings, and more. What Vocode provides:

- Conversation abstractions (streaming, turn-based)
- Conversation functionality (endpointing, emotion tracking)
- Integrations to all of the best speech-to-text/text-to-speech providers
- Cross-platform support (telephony, web, mobile, Zoom)
