## Overview

The idea behind creating your own AI agent is allowing complete control over the AI
layer of your application. Users will be responsible for implementing either a
`RESTfulAgent` or a `WebSocketAgent` that the Vocode backend will use to generate responses.

Both are just as easy to set up using the abstractions provided by the Vocode SDK. Note that the
websocket implementation will have a marginally faster performance due to the decreased overhead
for each query to the agent.

## RESTful Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `RESTfulAgent` that just echoes back whatever
input it receives. Note that the `respond` method is expecting a `RESTfulAgentOutput` return value.

```python
from vocode.user_implemented_agent.restful_agent import RESTfulAgent
from vocode.models.agent import RESTfulAgentOutput, RESTfulAgentText, RESTfulAgentEnd

class YourAgent(RESTfulAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str) -> RESTfulAgentOutput:
        if "bye" in input:
            return RESTfulAgentEnd()  ## ends the conversation
        else:
            return RESTfulAgentText(response=input)  ## responds with the input received
```

## WebSocket Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `WebSocketAgent` that just echoes back whatever input
it receives. Note that the `respond` method is expecting a `WebSocketAgentMessage` return value.

```python
from vocode.user_implemented_agent.websocket_agent import WebSocketAgent
from vocode.models.agent import WebSocketAgentMessage, WebSocketAgentTextMessage, WebSocketAgentStopMessage

class YourAgent(WebSocketAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str) -> WebSocketAgentMessage:
        if "bye" in input:
            return WebSocketAgentStopMessage()  ## ends the conversation
        else:
            return WebSocketAgentTextMessage.from_text(input)  ## responds with the input received
```
