## Overview

The idea behind creating your own AI agent is allowing complete control over the AI
layer of your application. Users will be responsible for implementing either a
`RESTfulAgent` or a `WebSocketAgent` that the Vocode backend will use to generate responses.

Both are just as easy to set up using the abstractions provided by Vocode. Note that the
websocket implementation will have a marginally faster performance due to the decreased overhead
for each query to the agent.

## RESTful Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `RESTfulAgent` that just echoes back whatever
input it receives. Note that the `respond` method is expecting a `RESTfulAgentOutput` return value.

```python
from vocode.user_implemented_agent.restful_agent import RESTfulAgent
from vocode.models.agent import RESTfulAgentOutput, RESTfulAgentText, RESTfulAgentEnd

class YourAgent(RESTfulAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str) -> RESTfulAgentOutput:
        if "bye" in input:
            return RESTfulAgentEnd()  ## ends the conversation
        else:
            return RESTfulAgentText(response=input)  ## responds with the input received
```

## WebSocket Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `WebSocketAgent` that just echoes back whatever input
it receives. Note that the `respond` method is expecting a `WebSocketAgentMessage` return value.

```python
from vocode.user_implemented_agent.websocket_agent import WebSocketAgent
from vocode.models.agent import WebSocketAgentMessage, WebSocketAgentTextMessage, WebSocketAgentStopMessage

class YourAgent(WebSocketAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str) -> WebSocketAgentMessage:
        if "bye" in input:
            return WebSocketAgentStopMessage()  ## ends the conversation
        else:
            return WebSocketAgentTextMessage.from_text(input)  ## responds with the input received
```
